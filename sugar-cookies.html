        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My go-to recipe, these Soft and Chewy Sugar Cookies are perfectly tender and soft with just the right amount of chewiness. They take just minutes to make with ingredients you may already have in your kitchen!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>2 sticks butter (cool room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups sugar, plus 1/4 cup (for rolling)</li>
            <li>1 egg plus 1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol class="lists">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt to combine.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed to beat the butter and 1¼ cups sugar until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla, and beat until combined, scraping the bowl down as needed. Slowly beat in the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Place the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a shallow dish. Using a large (3-tablespoon) spring-loaded scoop, divide the dough into balls, then roll in sugar to coat evenly. Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart, and flatten slightly with the bottom of a measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies set and begin to brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
        </ol>
